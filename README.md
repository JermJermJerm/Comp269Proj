# DoWhatNow
Originally a school project for the capstone course of my undergraduate degree, DoWhatNow? is a project management application intended to simplify and streamline project management planning and tracking.
## What?
At present, DoWhatNow helps project teams collaborate on projects, making it easier to identify existing objectives and track projet progress.
## How?
DoWhatNow is designed for the visually oriented. No need to sift through several messages and emails across multiple platforms. DoWhatNow uses large blocks to identify existing objectives, and colors to juxtapose the complete and incomplete.
## Features
* Account creation and deletion
* Create and delete projects
* Add tasks to projects
* Mark them as complete or incomplete
* Create a project team

TODO: 
* Screenshots
* Use patterns to aid the colorblind when colors would otherwise be confusing
* Invite other users to teams
* Associate teams with projects for visibility
